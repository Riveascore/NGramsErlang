Lain Trzaska was born on June 20, 1983 in Kraków, Poland. He moved to Sweden at the age of 5 where he learned to play piano and violin at an early age.

In 1997, he began creating music using FastTracker for computer games he had created.

Nowadays he often uses Renoise, (a DAW based upon the heritage and development of tracker software) to create his music.[citation needed]

In 2003, he created "she" so he could tell stories through music.

In June 2008, shortly after releasing Coloris, "she" was contacted by Japanese music label Pony Canyon for a record deal.[4]

In May 2012, Lain announced on Twitter that "she" has been put on indefinite hiatus.[5] He later clarified that only the band has been put on hiatus, not himself as an artist.[6]

A few days later, Lain announced that "shemusic" (a.k.a his style of music blend [mainly Electro House/Chiptune and Ambient Acoustic] released under his band "she") was going to split in two. Lain announced the new band as "Imagery by Sound". "she" and "Imagery by Sound" are now the two sides of "shemusic".

While "she" follows its way on Electro House & Chiptune, "Imagery by Sound" focuses now on the "ambient/acoustic & electro experimental part of "shemusic".

"Imagery by Sound" features the previous albums (Insomnia, Days, Digital Ambient Designs) from "she" as a related musical legacy.

Upcoming "Nights" album will be released under "Imagery by Sound".[7]

In September 2012, Lain announced that shemusic would release a new LP named "Electric Girl".
